Cloud users adopt the cloud computing services by utilizing the storage,
computational and network resources available in the data centre. Cloud offers three
important services in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service
(PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The Data centres cater the demand
of unlimited resources made by cloud users on pay per use basis with the help of
virtualization. In virtualization, Virtual Machines (VMs) are created and allocated
on top of the Physical Machines (PMs) in the form of computing instances of the PM.
To speed up the overall operations of application, parallel execution of workloads is
performed by VMs. In dynamic environment, the processing speed of virtual
machines vary from one PM to another due to the unpredictable workload arrival and
its allocation. This results in either overutilization or underutilization of VMs that
consequences load imbalance of data centre. The scheduling of the workload on
an appropriate virtual machine is an essential assignment to maintain stability and
avoid poor system performance.
